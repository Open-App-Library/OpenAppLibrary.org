Today I am very happy to announce [WideGuy](http://openapplibrary.org/project/wideguy)! A simple tool that solves a Linux gaming problem I came across.

It makes switching your monitors to a wide-picture mode (Xinerama) as easy as a click of a button.

Definitely give it a try if multi-monitor gaming is your thing.
