A minimal linux application for drawing and note-taking. It is designed for touch devices but should work just as well with drawing tablets too.

This app will support:

- Pinch-to-zoom
- Distraction-free canvas
- Easy-to-use interface
- Basic brush color and size control

This uses Gtk+3 and Cairo. Compile using make compile and run using make run. You could do both of these at the same time by just running make.
How to Compile

Compile the entire project using the following command:

    make

Run the project using the following command:

    make run
