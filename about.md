**The Open App Library Project's goal is to create a sustainable open-source software company** - one that does not rely on donations but instead sales of its products and services.

The first app and primary focus of the Open App Library will be [Vibrato Notes](https://vibrato.app), a powerful cross-platform note-taking application. It will operate under a SaaS business model and charge an estimated $10 a month for its cloud note-syncing service. You will have the option of self-hosting your own server at the expense of paying for your own server and providing your own server maintainence.

## Freedom over Price

When talking about free software it is important to understand the difference between "libre" and "gratis", two latin words that offer distinctions that the English language cannot.

- "Libre" means free; Free as in freedom.
- "Gratis" means free; Free as in price.

The belief of this project is that 'libre' software is the holy grail - the only aspect that truly matters is having your code public and using a fair license that promotes freedom. (See the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License))

There are several expected benefits to implementing a business model into open-source software

- More predictable funding
- Faster growth
- Developers have a greater chance of building a full-time income
- Full-time developers will be able to put in more time to the project
- Larger and more predictable funding means you are able to purchase more resources, services, and equipment to help your project.

## Different ways to implement an open-source business model

Vibrato Notes will follow an excellent open-source business model. All of the apps will be free whether you are on desktop or mobile. You will not need an account to use them.

However, we will offer a very convinient and seamless cloud syncing service, similar to Evernote, at a reasonable price.

It will save the user from spending time and money maintaining a self-hosted Vibrato Notes instance and also give them the peace of mind knowing that their data was encrypted on the client side (We can't read your notes if we wanted to) and they are funding us to provide a reliable service.

### Paid apps

The Mac App Store shows how much potential there is for indie developers to make money selling paid software. The prices I have seen vary from $4 to $20.

If a piece of software solves my problems better than what is availible and has a reasonable price, I have no problem paying money for it.

Now, the big question. Why would anyone pay money for software that they could get for free?

To answer that, we have to go over what "get" entails.

If you have your code on Github, "getting your software for free" means that they have to either clone your repository or download it as a zip and then compile everything. After the program is compiled they then would have to package it in some way, shape or form or move it to the proper system location.

That's not an easy task that every person could do. Not only that, they also need to manually update and recompile the application.

This offers you the ability to sell the executable and leave the source code open.

There is one clear flaw though. What is stopping a fellow developer from killing your proftiability by distributing pre-compiled executables for free?

Well, you could write this off in the hope that people won't trust that person and that the person could be slow distributing the updates. You could also hope that after people try the software and fall in love with it they will buy your version.

My idea, which may be the most controversial part of this page is creating a license that disallows users from freely distributing your application for the purpose of bypassing your payment.

This idea gets challenging when you want to disallow people from "pirating" your software as described above but you also want to enable people to fork your work and create their own version.
